+++

Exploring deep learning techniques for future event prediction in discontinuous time-series.
   * Developed encoder-decoder framework for reconstruction and prediction, for both continuous and discontinuous time-series.
   * Implemented Soft-DTW loss for time series and explored application to point-process techniques for discontinuous time-series.
