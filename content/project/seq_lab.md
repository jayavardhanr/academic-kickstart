Experimental study of State-of-the-art deep learning models for different Sequence Labeling tasks in NLP

  * Performed comparitive study of different modeling choices
  
    1. CRF vs softmax layer
    2. LSTM vs CNN character embeddings
    3. Effect of language models
    4. Effect of size of vocabulary
