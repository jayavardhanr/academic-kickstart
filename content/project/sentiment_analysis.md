**Project Summary:**

  * Implemented two methodologies and compared them â€“ firstly, using a lexicon-based approach and then, with machine learning techniques like SVM, Logistic Regression, artificial neural networks. SVM performed the best of all, due to the constrained size of training dataset used.

**Recent Developments:**

  * Recent Development: Performed sentiment analysis of yelp reviews using LSTM, Bi-directiional LSTMs, Convolutional Neural Networks.
  * Simple LSTM model produced the best accuracy, the Bidirectional LSTM overfits on the data and doesnot produce better results compared to the LSTM Network.
