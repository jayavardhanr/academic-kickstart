**Project Summary:**

  * Implemented two methodologies and compared them 
        * Firstly, using a lexicon-based approach 
        * Secondly using machine learning techniques like SVM, Logistic Regression, artificial neural networks. 
  * SVM performed the best of all, due to the constrained size of training dataset used.

**Recent Developments:**

  * Recent Development: Performed sentiment analysis of yelp reviews using LSTM, Bi-directiional LSTMs, Convolutional Neural Networks.
  * Simple LSTM model produced the best accuracy. Suprisingly, the Bidirectional LSTM overfits on the data does not produce better results compared to the LSTM Network.
  
**FrameWorks**
  * Keras, Tensorflow, scikit-learn, NLTK
