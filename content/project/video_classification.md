summary = "Classify Videoâ€™s based on the actions performed in the video using Image Captining"

+++

We try utilize existing Image Captioning models to classify video's into different categories based on the actions performed in them.
  * First, we create Frame-description pairs using NeuralTalk model for different frames in the video.
  * We train a machine learning model on this Frame-description pairs to classify video into different categories.
  * Model achived accuries in the range of 36%. 
 
**Error Analysis:** 
  1. Model fails to detect actions like a person sitting down or standing up because image captioning fails to capture these subtle differences when it handles one frame at a time. 
  2. Also, the model learns wrong signals like "When it sees a chair, it always always says sitting"
